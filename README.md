The EMS allows a user to maintain information related to entertainment acts, venues they may perform in, and specific shows of an act at a venue.

A user can create an account and create acts, venues and shows, providing the following information for each instance type.

Act:
 * Name
 * Description
 * Size
 * Home Location
 * Website

Venue:
 * Name
 * Address
 * Zipcode
 * Phone
 * E-mail Address
 * Website

Show:
 * Name

Any logged in user may view information about any act, venue, or show, and can create a new record of each type. However, a user may only edit or delete the acts, venues, or shows which were originally created by them.
